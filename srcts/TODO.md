# Rules
* Import at top
* Export at bottom
* Any `window.***` calls are done in `./external` folder only.
  * Add exported values / function if necessary.
  * This helps keep each file self contained. Trying not to have random inputs from anywhere

# TODO

* es6 shiny.js
  * âˆš Pass in version before compilation
    (* Can be run many times safely)
  * Convert each js file to ts
  * validate polyfills are working by finding them in the code
  * delete 'old' folder
  * delete 'shiny-es5' files
* es6 other shiny files (ex: showcasemode)
* Document package.json scripts
* Produce minified shiny js


# Later TODO

* break up `./utils` into many files
* remove any `: any` types
* fix all `// eslint-disable-next-line no-prototype-builtins` lines
* Convert FileProcessor to a true class definition
